        <p>Animal behavior encompasses the diverse ways in which animals interact 
            with each other and their environments. This field of study investigates 
            activities such as communication through vocalizations or chemical signals, 
            foraging strategies for food acquisition, and complex mating rituals. Social behaviors,
             like the establishment of dominance hierarchies and cooperative breeding,
              illustrate the intricate relationships within animal groups.</p>
